Perfect - Ed Sheeran

Sorry... I missed this

But darling just kiss me slow,
your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine
Baby I'm dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass,
listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess,
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman,
stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams,
I hope that someday I'll share her home
