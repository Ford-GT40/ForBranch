I found a love, to carry more
than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love,
fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand,
be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby I'm dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening
to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress,
looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this,
darling you look perfect tonight
Baby I'm dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass,
listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect, no I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight 접기
